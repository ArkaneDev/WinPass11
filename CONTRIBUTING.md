# Contributing
🖥️ We'd love feedback and changes to our projects to help our projects stay the best they can, and you can help!

## Prerequisites
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes
>Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work, typically the main branch.

>Only target release branches if you are certain your changes are concerned with that branch.

>To quickly create a topic branch based on main, `run git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution main`.

>Avoid working directly on the main branch.

>Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

# Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the puppetlabs organization.
