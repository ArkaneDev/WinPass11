# WinPass11: Guided

**Join us on Discord**: https://discord.gg/bD2TMR8t29

ðŸ”‘ [WinPass11](https://github.com/winbyte-devs/WinPass11) is a tool for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware in a guided "installer-like" format. Our goal is for the end-user to easily run a single executable and have access to Windows 11 through the dev channel without having to worry about unsupported hardware. This program supports bypassing all of the Windows 11 requirements!

## Installation
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/winbyte-devs/WinPass11/releases).
* Execute the program named: `WinPass11.GuidedInstaller-Guided_{version}.exe`. You should be asked by UAC to run as administrator, if not, re-run as administrator.
