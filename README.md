ðŸ”‘ [WinPass11](https://github.com/project-winpass11) Guided Installer is a tool for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware with a guided walkthrough. Our goal is to let the end-user easily run a single executable and have access to Windows 11 through the dev channel with no worries about your unsupported hardware. This program will support bypassing unsupported processors, the TPM 2.0 requirement, the secure boot check and hopefully more!

## Prerequisites
* [Microsoft .NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1)
