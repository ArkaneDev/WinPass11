ðŸ”‘ [WinPass11](https://github.com/project-winpass11) Guided Installer is a tool for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware through a walkthrough process. Our goal is for the end-user to easily run a single executable and have access to Windows 11 through the dev channel with no worries about unsupported hardware. This program supports bypassing all of the Windows 11 requirements!

## Installation
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/project-winpass11/WinPass11.GuidedInstaller/releases).
* Execute the program named: `WinPass11.GuidedInstaller_{version}.exe`. You should be asked by UAC to run as administrator, if not re-run as administrator.
